# Mazunte Connect Landing Page - Design System

## Overview

This document outlines the design principles and decisions made to create a cohesive, beach-inspired aesthetic for the Mazunte Connect landing page, based on the app's brand identity.

## Design Philosophy

**From Dark to Light, From Digital to Natural**

The redesign transformed the landing page from a modern dark theme to a warm, inviting beach aesthetic that reflects Mazunte's natural beauty and the app's purpose as a connector for the community.

## Color Palette

### Primary Colors (Inspired by the App Icon)

The entire color scheme is derived from the Mazunte Connect icon, which features:
- A warm peachy/sandy background
- An orange sun with rays
- Turquoise ocean waves
- Rich brown typography

#### Background Colors
- **Base**: `from-amber-50 via-orange-50 to-amber-100`
- **Warm sand tones** that evoke the beach atmosphere
- Gradient approach creates depth and visual interest

#### Accent Colors
1. **Orange** (`#f59e0b`, `#fb923c`, `#f97316`)
   - Primary accent representing the sun
   - Used for: Primary CTAs, icons, highlights

2. **Teal/Turquoise** (`#14b8a6`, `#0d9488`)
   - Secondary accent representing ocean waves
   - Used for: Secondary accents, interactive elements, gradients

3. **Amber/Brown** (`#b45309`, `#78350f`, `#451a03`)
   - Tertiary colors for depth
   - Used for: Borders, subtle accents, transitions

#### Text Colors
- **Primary Text**: `amber-950` (#451a03) - Rich dark brown for maximum readability
- **Secondary Text**: `amber-800` (#92400e) - Medium brown for body text
- **Tertiary Text**: `amber-700` (#b45309) - Lighter brown for supporting text

### Color Transitions

**Before → After**
- Black (`#000000`) → Warm peachy gradient (`amber-50/orange-50/amber-100`)
- White (`#ffffff`) → Rich brown (`amber-950`)
- Blue/Purple gradients → Orange/Teal gradients
- Pink accents → Teal accents
- Gray text → Warm brown text

## Typography

### Hierarchy
- **H1 (Logo)**: 3xl-4xl, gradient from orange → teal → amber
- **H2 (Hero)**: 5xl-7xl, animated gradient
- **H3 (Sections)**: 4xl-5xl, solid amber-950
- **Body**: xl-2xl, amber-800
- **Small**: sm-base, amber-700

### Font Treatment
- Maintained existing font stack (system fonts)
- Updated gradient colors to match new palette
- Kept bold weights for headers for clarity against light backgrounds

## Component Design Patterns

### Cards
**Structure**: White/transparent background with warm shadows

```
- Background: bg-white/80 (80% opacity white)
- Backdrop blur: backdrop-blur-xl
- Border: border-amber-900/20
- Shadow: shadow-lg
- Hover state: Increases border opacity to /30
```

### Buttons & CTAs

#### Primary CTA
- Gradient: `from-orange-500 via-teal-500 to-amber-600`
- White text
- Shadow on hover
- Scale transform (105%)

#### Secondary Elements
- White/amber background
- Brown text
- Subtle hover states

### Language Switcher
- Pill-shaped toggle
- Active state: Orange-to-teal gradient with white text
- Inactive state: Transparent with brown text
- Smooth transitions between states

## Visual Effects

### Background Animations
```css
Animated mesh orbs:
- Orange orb (top-left): 7s pulse
- Teal orb (top-right): 9s pulse with 2s delay
- Amber orb (bottom-left): 11s pulse with 4s delay
```

### Spotlight Effect
- Follows mouse movement
- Teal-based radial gradient (`rgba(20, 184, 166, 0.12)`)
- Creates depth and interactivity

### Grid Overlay
- Subtle brown grid lines (`rgba(120,53,15,0.1)`)
- 50px × 50px pattern
- Adds texture without distraction

## Accessibility Considerations

### Contrast Ratios
- **Primary text** (amber-950 on amber-50): ~12:1 (AAA)
- **Secondary text** (amber-800 on amber-50): ~7:1 (AA+)
- **CTA text** (white on orange-500): ~4.5:1 (AA)

### Interactive Elements
- Minimum touch target: 44×44px
- Clear hover states
- Focus indicators maintained
- Color not sole differentiator (icons + text)

## Responsive Design

### Breakpoints
- Mobile-first approach
- Tailwind default breakpoints: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px)
- Font sizes scale appropriately
- Grid layouts stack on mobile

### Mobile Optimizations
- Language switcher remains visible and usable
- Cards maintain readability
- Touch targets appropriately sized
- Reduced motion on small screens

## Icon Integration

### App Icon Usage
- Added actual Mazunte Connect icon to header
